                                 NOTE.


These hymns have grown out of Christian work among the Indians. They
repeat often, because they are intended chiefly for Indians who cannot
read, and hence must memorize them; but as soon as they learn to read,
they sing in English. It will be noticed that often two syllables must be
sung to one note, as in the first word in No. 9, _nika_ is sung to the
first note of "Happy Land," and in No. 2, in the first line, _skookum_ is
sung to one note. The chief peculiarity which I have noticed in making
hymns in this language is, that a large proportion of the words are often
two syllables, and a large majority of these have the accent on the
second syllable, which renders it almost impossible to compose any hymns
in long, common or short metres. In the second edition a hymn has been
added in each of the Skokomish, Nisqually and Clallam languages, and also
a medley in the four languages.
